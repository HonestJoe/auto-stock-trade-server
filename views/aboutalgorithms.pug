    div.tab-content-header What is Beta?
    div.tab-content-body Beta is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security 
      | or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is used in the capital 
      | asset pricing model (CAPM), which calculates the expected return of an asset based on 
      | its beta and expected market returns. Beta is also known as the beta coefficient.
    div.tab-content-header How is Beta calculated?
    div.tab-content-body Beta is calculated using regression analysis. Beta represents the 
      | tendency of a security's returns to respond to swings in the market. A security's beta 
      | is calculated by dividing the covariance the security's returns and the benchmark's 
      | returns by the variance of the benchmark's returns over a specified period.
    
  div(class="tab-wrapper" id="RSI")
    div.tab-content-header What is RSI?
    div.tab-content-body The relative strength index (RSI) is a momentum indicator developed by 
      | noted technical analyst Welles Wilder, that compares the magnitude of recent gains and 
      | losses over a specified time period to measure speed and change of price movements of a 
      | security. It is primarily used to attempt to identify overbought or oversold conditions 
      | in the trading of an asset.
    div.tab-content-header How is RSI calculated and used?
    div.tab-content-body The relative strength index is calculated using the following formula: 
      | RSI = 100 - 100 / (1 + RS) Where RS = Average gain of up periods during the specified  
      | time frame / Average loss of down periods during the specified time frame. Traditional 
      | interpretation and usage of the RSI is that RSI values of 70 or above indicate that a 
      | security is becoming overbought or overvalued, and therefore may be primed for a trend 
      | reversal or corrective pullback in price. On the other side of RSI values, an RSI reading 
      | of 30 or below is commonly interpreted as indicating an oversold or undervalued condition 
      | that may signal a trend change or corrective price reversal to the upside.
