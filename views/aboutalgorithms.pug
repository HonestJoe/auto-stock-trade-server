      div.tab-content-header What is Beta?
      div.tab-content-body Beta is a measure of the volatility, or systematic risk, of a security 
        | or a portfolio in comparison to the market as a whole. Beta is used in the capital 
        | asset pricing model (CAPM), which calculates the expected return of an asset based on 
        | its beta and expected market returns. Beta is also known as the beta coefficient. By 
        | definition, the market has a beta of 1.0, and individual stocks are ranked according to 
        | how much they deviate from the market. A stock that swings more than the market over 
        | time has a beta above 1.0. If a stock moves less than the market, the stock's beta is 
        | less than 1.0. High-beta stocks are supposed to be riskier but provide a potential for 
        | higher returns; low-beta stocks pose less risk but also lower returns.
      div.tab-content-header How is Beta calculated?
      div.tab-content-body Beta is calculated using regression analysis. Beta represents the 
        | tendency of a security's returns to respond to swings in the market. A security's beta 
        | is calculated by dividing the covariance the security's returns and the benchmark's 
        | returns by the variance of the benchmark's returns over a specified period.
      div.tab-content-header Is Beta safe to use?
      div.tab-content-body A stock's price variability is important to consider when assessing 
        | risk. If you think about risk as the possibility of a stock losing its value, beta has 
        | appeal as a proxy for risk. Intuitively, it makes plenty of sense. Think of an early-stage 
        | technology stock with a price that bounces up and down more than the market. It's hard 
        | not to think that stock will be riskier than, say, a safe-haven utility industry stock 
        | with a low beta. There are variations on beta depending on things such as the market 
        | index used and the time period measured â€“ but broadly speaking, the notion of beta is 
        | fairly straightforward. It's a convenient measure that can be used to calculate the costs 
        | of equity used in a valuation method that discounts cash flows.

    div(class="tab-wrapper" id="RSI")
      div.tab-content-header What is RSI?
      div.tab-content-body RSI stands for "Relative Strength Index". It is a momentum indicator 
        | developed by noted technical analyst Welles Wilder, that compares the magnitude of recent 
        | gains and losses over a specified time period to measure speed and change of price movements 
        | of a security. It is primarily used to attempt to identify overbought or oversold conditions 
        | in the trading of an asset.
      div.tab-content-header How is RSI calculated?
      div.tab-content-body The relative strength index is calculated using the following formula: 
      div.tab-content-body
      div.tab-content-body RSI = 100 - 100 / (1 + RS) 
      div.tab-content-body
      div.tab-content-body Where RS = [Average of Upward Price Change] / [Average of Downward Price Change]
      div.tab-content-header How is RSI used?
      div.tab-content-body Traditional interpretation and usage of the RSI is that RSI values of 
        | 70 or above indicate that a security is becoming overbought or overvalued, and therefore 
        | may be primed for a trend reversal or corrective pullback in price. On the other side of 
        | RSI values, an RSI reading of 30 or below is commonly interpreted as indicating an oversold 
        | or undervalued condition that may signal a trend change or corrective price reversal to 
        | the upside.

    div(class="tab-wrapper" id="MACD")
      div.tab-content-header What is MACD and how is it used?
      div.tab-content-body MACD stands for "Moving Average Convergence Divergence". Developed by 
        | Gerald Appel in the late seventies, MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows 
        | the relationship between two moving averages of prices. The MACD is calculated by subtracting 
        | the 26-day exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-day EMA. A nine-day EMA of the MACD, 
        | called the "signal line", is then plotted on top of the MACD, functioning as a trigger for buy 
        | and sell signals. As its name implies, the MACD is all about the convergence and divergence of 
        | the two moving averages. Convergence occurs when the moving averages move towards each other. 
        | Divergence occurs when the moving averages move away from each other. The shorter moving 
        | average (12-day EMA) is faster and responsible for most MACD movements. The longer moving 
        | average (26-day EMA) is slower and less reactive to price changes in the underlying security.
      div.tab-content-header Signal Line Crossovers:
      div.tab-content-body Signal line crossovers are the most common MACD signals. The signal line is 
        | a 9-day EMA of the MACD Line. As a moving average of the indicator, it trails the MACD and 
        | makes it easier to spot MACD turns. A bullish crossover occurs when the MACD turns up and 
        | crosses above the signal line. A bearish crossover occurs when the MACD turns down and crosses 
        | below the signal line. Crossovers can last a few days or a few weeks, it all depends on the 
        | strength of the move.
      div.tab-content-header Centerline Crossovers:
      div.tab-content-body Centerline crossovers are the next most common MACD signals. A bullish 
        | centerline crossover occurs when the MACD Line moves above the zero line to turn positive. 
        | This happens when the 12-day EMA of the underlying security moves above the 26-day EMA. A 
        | bearish centerline crossover occurs when the MACD moves below the zero line to turn negative. 
        | This happens when the 12-day EMA moves below the 26-day EMA. Centerline crossovers can last a 
        | few days or a few months. It all depends on the strength of the trend. The MACD will remain 
        | positive as long as there is a sustained uptrend. The MACD will remain negative when there is 
        | a sustained downtrend.
      div.tab-content-header Divergences:
      div.tab-content-body Divergences form when the MACD diverges from the price action of the underlying 
        | security. A bullish divergence forms when a security records a lower low and the MACD forms a 
        | higher low. The lower low in the security affirms the current downtrend, but the higher low in 
        | the MACD shows less downside momentum. Despite less downside momentum, downside momentum is still 
        | outpacing upside momentum as long as the MACD remains in negative territory. Slowing downside 
        | momentum can sometimes foreshadow a trend reversal or a sizable rally.

      div.tab-content-header What is a "Trend"?
      div.tab-content-body The trend is the general direction of a market or of the price of a security. In 
        | technical analysis, trends are identified by trend lines that connect a series of highs or lows. 
        | Most traders trade in the same direction as a trend, while contrarians seek to identify reversals. 
        | Trends can also apply to interest rates, bond yields, and other markets where they're characterized 
        | by a long-term movement in price or volume.
      div.tab-content-header How are Trend Lines used?
      div.tab-content-body As stated above, trend lines connect a series of highs or lows. Uptrends connect a 
        | series of higher lows, creating a key support level for future price movements. Downtrends connect 
        | a series of lower highs, creating a key resistance level for future price movements. In addition to 
        | support and resistance, these trend lines show the overall direction of the trend.
